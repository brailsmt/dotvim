"	Documentation:
"		This script looks for the file ~/.vim/templates/template.cpp.  In that
"		file are several fields that this looks for and will replace with the
"		information it parsed from the header file.  if you have a header file
"		in a source directory and you want to create the .cpp source file for
"		it then ":e file.cpp" (or :sp, i use a script that allows easy
"		alternation via ":A") will create file.cpp based on the existing
"		file.h header.  The tags which tmp_gen searches for are:
"
"		<FILENAME> -- will be replaced with the name of the class in lowercase.
"		<YEAR>     -- will be replaced by the current year with century.
"		<DEFINE>   -- will be replaced with the name of the class in uppercase
"		<HEADER>   -- the same as <FILENAME>
"		<CLASSNAME>-- replaced with the name of the class, preserves the case
"		<TIMESTAMP>-- replaced with the timestamp in the following format "Sun Nov 24 01:51:27 MST 2002"
"		<CONSTRUCTORS>  -- replaced by the constructors from the header file,
"			the constructors also will have the data members in the body, to
"			make it easier to initialize them (saves lots of typing).
"		<METHODS>       -- replaced by the methods from the header file,
"			including the argument lists, though no names are given to the
"			parameters.
"
"		This list of tags will grow.
"
"	Installation:
"		In order to get this to work, put the following line your .vimrc.
