" Description: insert mode template expander with cursor placement
"              while preserving filetype indentation.
" Last Change: Mon Dec 02 04:00 AM 2002 PST
" 
" Documentation: {{{
"
" Motivation:
" this script provides a way to generate insert mode mappings which do not
" suffer from some of the problem of mappings and abbreviations while allowing
" cursor placement after the expansion. It can alternatively be thought of as
" a template expander. 
"
" Consider an example. If you do
"
" imap lhs something
"
" then a mapping is set up. However, there will be the following problems:
" 1. the 'ttimeout' option will generally limit how easily you can type the
"    lhs. if you type the left hand side too slowly, then the mapping will not
"    be activated.
" 2. if you mistype one of the letters of the lhs, then the mapping is
"    deactivated as soon as you backspace to correct the mistake.
"
" If, in order to take care of the above problems, you do instead
"
" iab lhs something
"
" then the timeout problem is solved and so is the problem of mistyping.
" however, abbreviations are only expanded after typing a non-word character.
" which causes problems of cursor placement after the expansion and invariably
" spurious spaces are inserted.
" 
" Usage Example:
" this script attempts to solve all these problems by providing an emulation
" of imaps wchich does not suffer from its attendant problems. Because maps
" are activated without having to press additional characters, therefore
" cursor placement is possible. furthermore, file-type specific indentation is
" preserved, because the rhs is expanded as if the rhs is typed in literally
" by the user.
"  
" The script already provides some default mappings. each "mapping" is of the
" form:
"
" call IMAP (lhs, rhs, ft)
" 
" Some characters in the RHS have special meaning which help in cursor
" placement.
"
" Example One:
"
" 	call IMAP ("bit`", "\\begin{itemize}\<cr>\\item «»\<cr>\\end{itemize}«»", "tex")
" 
" This effectively sets up the map for "bit`" whenever you edit a latex file.
" When you type in this sequence of letters, the following text is inserted:
" 
" \begin{itemize}
" \item *
" \end{itemize}«»
"
" where * shows the cursor position. The cursor position after inserting the
" text is decided by the position of the first "place-holder". Place holders
" are special characters which decide cursor placement and movement. In the
" example above, the place holder characters are « and ». After you have typed
" in the item, press <C-j> and you will be taken to the next set of «»'s.
" Therefore by placing the «» characters appropriately, you can minimize the
" use of movement keys.
"
" NOTE: Set g:Imap_UsePlaceHolders to 0 to disable placeholders altogether.
" Set 
" 	g:Imap_PlaceHolderStart and g:Imap_PlaceHolderEnd
" to something else if you want different place holder characters.
" Also, b:Imap_PlaceHolderStart and b:Imap_PlaceHolderEnd override the values
" of g:Imap_PlaceHolderStart and g:Imap_PlaceHolderEnd respectively. This is
" useful for setting buffer specific place hoders.
" 
" Example Two:
" You can use the <C-r> command to insert dynamic elements such as dates.
"	call IMAP ('date`', "\<c-r>=strftime('%b %d %Y')\<cr>", '')
"
" sets up the map for date` to insert the current date.
"
"--------------------------------------%<--------------------------------------
" Bonus: This script also provides a command Snip which puts tearoff strings,
" '----%<----' above and below the visually selected range of lines. The
" length of the string is chosen to be equal to the longest line in the range.

" functions for easy insert mode mappings.
" ==============================================================================
" IMAP: Adds a "fake" insert mode mapping. {{{
"       For example, doing
"           IMAP('abc', 'def' ft) 
"       will mean that if the letters abc are pressed in insert mode, then
"       they will be replaced by def. If ft != '', then the "mapping" will be
"       specific to the files of type ft. 
"
"       Using IMAP has a few advantages over simply doing:
"           imap abc def
"       1. with imap, if you begin typing abc, the cursor will not advance and
"          long as there is a possible completion, the letters a, b, c will be
"          displayed on on top of the other. using this function avoids that.
"       2. with imap, if a backspace or arrow key is pressed before completing
"          the word, then the mapping is lost. this function allows movement. 
"          (this ofcourse means that this function is only limited to
"          left-hand-sides which do not have movement keys or unprintable
"          characters)
"       It works by only mapping the last character of the left-hand side.
"       when this character is typed in, then a reverse lookup is done and if
"       the previous characters consititute the left hand side of the mapping,
"       the previously typed characters and erased and the right hand side is
"       inserted
